\begin{abstract}

All reports start with an abstract, which contains a summary of the project: its
aim, what was done and, most important, what was achieved. This document
describes the requirements for a project report in the School of Engineering and
gives advice on how to get better marks. It is structured to match a project
report as far as possible so that the document can be used as a template.
