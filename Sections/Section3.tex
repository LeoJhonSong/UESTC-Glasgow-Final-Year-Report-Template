\section{Analysis and Discussion}

The discussion is your opportunity to impress an expert with your depth of
understanding. Don’t worry so much about the non-expert reader – she or he can
skip to the Conclusions. All engineering projects are expected to show technical
analysis and this section is a good place.

For a research project this section should provide a logical argument leading
from the experimental observations to the final conclusions. Evaluate your
results thoroughly and gain every possible piece of understanding from them.
Compare the results in detail to other work in the field. This should be a
critical comparison so don’t just say that your results are different from
previous work; explain why. Never say ‘The results were as expected’ unless you
have already described exactly what was expected.

The main purpose of the Discussion in a design-and-build project is to assess
the performance of your product against the specification, using the insight
that you have gained to show the product’s strengths and weaknesses.
