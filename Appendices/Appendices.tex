\section{Appendices}

Use appendices for supporting material which is relevant but of a detailed
nature. In this way the flow of ideas in the body of the report is not
interrupted. Appendices should be lettered rather than numbered to distinguish
them. Several uses for appendices have been suggested already. Assessors are not
obliged to read appendices so do not put vital points here.

Lengthy appendices should be submitted on a CD or thumb drive with paper copies
of the report but must be included as an integral part of the electronic
submission.
